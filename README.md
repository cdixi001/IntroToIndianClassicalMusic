## Course Summary
This course introduces students to the basics of Hindustani Classical Music through vocal instruction.
No musical experience is necessary.
Students are exposed to the concepts of raaga (distinct melodies) and taala (rhythmic cycles).
These basic building blocks are covered in different forms of Hindustani music such as Dhrupad and Khayal.
Improvisation is a big part of Indian music, so students also learn to improvise in different raagas and styles.

## Course Summary
This course will introduce students to the basics of Hindustani Classical Music through vocal instruction. No musical experience is necessary. Students will be exposed to the concepts of raaga (distinct melodies) and taala (rhythmic cycles). These basic building blocks will be learned through different forms of Hindustani music such as Dhrupad and Khayal. Students will also learn to improvise, a major part of Indian music, in different raagas and styles. This course will focus on vocal performance with some theory interwoven throughout the 10 weeks.

## Course Objectives
